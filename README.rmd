## ** This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.**

#### The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following: 

1. Creates a folder in your working directory - 'Week4_Assignment'
2. Download the zip archive and unzip it to created folder
3. Loads the row data
4. Merges the datasets (train and test) to one, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
5. Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair
6. On the off-chance script also creates addition files (tidy data and requested data) - for the final choice of user.
7. Four .txt files of output should appear in the created folder

run_analisys.R consists comments before each line of code, so you can read additional details there
